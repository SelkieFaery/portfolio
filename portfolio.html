<h3>Web Developing:</h3>
<br>
<h4>1. Registration Form (2018)</h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://selkiefaery.github.io/form/"><img src="images/form.PNG" alt="a simple form with JavaScript Validation" class="image2"></a>
<br>
This is a simple form I made for my Fundamentals of JavaScript class at UMUC.  
I wrote the HML, CSS, and JavaScript used in this. It uses JavaScript to validate 
required fields.  This is a simple, functioning form that will email me, if everything is entered correctly.  
It has several fields, including a radio buttons and checkboxes that must be completed.  First name, last 
name, city, zip code, phone number, and area code must be filled out correctly.  State uses a dropdown menu 
and something must be selected.  The email must be a valid email and the confirm email must match.  If 
anything is filled out incorrectly, an alert message states the error and does not allow the form 
to be submitted.
<br>
<br>
<h4>2. Image Gallery (2018)</h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://selkiefaery.github.io/photogallery/"><img src="images/photogallery.PNG" alt="a simple JavaScript image gallery" class="image2"></a>
<br>
This piece is a simple image gallery, also created for my Fundamentals of JavaScript class at UMUC. This 
was my first project for my class.  It is a collaboration between my professor and myself.  The HTML and 
CSS code was provided by my professor and I added the JavaScript that allows the photo gallery to be interactive.  
Initially, there is no main image, but only a couple of thumbnail images of various flowers on a black 
background.  When moussing over the images, a short, corresponding description of the image displays under 
the thumbnails.  Clicking on a thumbnail will display the image as the main image and turn the header red. 
<br>
<br>
<h4>3. Ticket Purchasing (2018)</h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://selkiefaery.github.io/eventregistration/"><img src="images/ticket.PNG" alt="a simple ticket purchasing system" class="image2"></a>
<br>
This is a simple ticket purchasing system, also created for my Fundamentals of JavaScript class.  The HTML and 
CSS was provided by my professor and I added the JavaScript.  The system allows a customer to purchase between 1 and 3 
tickets for an event.  Attempting to purchase more than 3 or less than 1 ticket will return an error.  Once 
the amount is entered, clicking out of the box will update the total cost and display the rest of the form.  
A name and email address must be entered correctly, or an error will be displayed.  A confirmation window 
displays when purchase is complete.  No credit card information is requested, the form does not get submitted 
anywhere, no tickets are actually purchased.
<br>
<br>
<h4>4. The Princess Closet (2018)</h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://theprincesscloset.biz"><img src="images/theprincesscloset.PNG" alt="my clothing store" class="image2"></a>
<br>
This is my personal website I started working on when I began my first HTML class with UMUC. 
I created all HML, CSS, JavaScript, and content used in this.  The images were provided and credit is
given on the site.  This website 
will be used to sell my homemade clothes and accessories. The website, as well as my sewing, had to get 
pushed to the side while I focused on school, but will up updated shortly.  I have been playing around with 
the style, and adding features as I learn.  It looks quite a bit different than when I first started, but it 
is still nowhere near complete.  I plan to add a logo, including the title, as a clickable link to the homepage, 
multiple images that automatically change on the home page, and clickable images that navigate to the different 
categories on the home page.  I also plan to add a lot more content and display featured items and sales on the 
home page.

This is a sample magazine spread I created using Adobe InDesign CC 2018 for my Fundamentals of electronic 
Publishing class at UMUC.  This is a fictional magazine spread using images and articles taken from the 
internet.  The images are from pixabay.com and the article is from https://teachyoutosew.com/sewing-101.  
I put it all together to create the fictional magazine spread, to include the front page and the center pages.  
The audience of this magazine is intended to be anybody who is interested in learning to sew, using todays 
modern styles, techniques, and equipment.  I chose the font and colors to be visually appealing, as well as 
for easy readability.

<br>
This is a sample wedding program I created using Adobe InDesign CC 2018 for my Fundamentals of electronic 
Publishing class at UMUC.  This is a fictional wedding program using images from pixabay.com and the content was
provided by my professor.  I chose all designs, colors, images, and fonts used.  This program is for a 
fictional wedding and all names and dates are fictional.
